    "discussion": "Skeletal muscle has a remarkable ability to adapt to changes in workload. Almost all muscle properties can be modulated, such as muscle fiber size, contractile properties and metabolism. Changes in patterns of gene expression as well as shifts in the balance between protein synthesis and degradation are required to complete the adaptational response. Identification of major pathways that directly regulate gene expression and protein synthesis/degradation demonstrate that multiple inputs (mechanical, chemical, and metabolic) can converge on final common pathways for muscle growth and adaptation (reviewed in [45]). However, sorting out the contribution of the wide variety of inputs on muscle adaptation has been more difficult. In our previous work, we used an eccentric contraction protocol to investigate the dependence of ERK1/2 mechano-sensing on phosphorylation of \u03b3-SG. However, this protocol alters multiple factors, including externally applied tension, internally generated tension and changes in extracellular and intracellular calcium fluxes, all of which potentially have effects on mechanosensitive signaling pathways. In the present study, we used a passive stretching protocol to isolate the effects of externally applied tension in the absence of active contraction, in order to examine the downstream signaling in more detail.\n\nPassive stretching protocols can be performed in both cell cultures and whole muscle preparations, and the reductionist approach of utilizing cultures can eliminate some of the physiological complexities associated with intact or isolated muscles. As such, our initial experiments using C2C12 cells were key to identifying p70S6K as being activated in response to stretch, in contrast to the lack of response by ERK1/2, Akt, or FAK. Primary myotubes generated from C57 or \u03b3-SG-/-mice had the distinct advantage of efficient germline elimination of \u03b3-SG combined with anin vitroculture system. Even though these experiments displayed trends towards differential activation of p70S6K after stretch, the inherent variability of the preparation impaired identification of signaling patterns that were dependent upon either stretch or \u03b3-SG. Thus, we returned to isolated muscles from C57 and \u03b3-SG-/-mice to investigate \u03b3-SG-dependent mechanotransduction pathways. Using this model, we observed a modest increase of P-p70S6K in \u03b3-SG-/-muscles at rest that was independent of intra- or extracellular calcium, and a prolonged activation of p70S6K following stretch. These results support a role for \u03b3-SG in particular, or the SG complex in general, in mechanical signal transduction, where the loss of this protein leads to an increase in activation, and deficit in deactivation, or a combination of both. Given the dependence of our findings on the experimental platform utilized, future directions will include verification of the results in an even more intact system, such asin situmuscle preparations or whole animals.\n\nAn intriguing explanation for ourin vivoresults is that \u03b3-SG is required for dephosphorylation and deactivation of p70S6K. There is considerable evidence that p70S6K is directly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), independently of mTOR [46-49]. The phosphatase PHLPP has also been shown to target p70S6K [50]. \u03b3-SG may mediate the activation of these phosphatases in response to sustained mechanical stimulation. Alternatively, \u03b3-SG may regulate pathways that deactivate p70S6K indirectly. For example, the phosphatase SHP-2 can cause mTOR-dependent dephosphorylation of p70S6K [51,52]. Further studies will be required to define the inactivation pathway disrupted by \u03b3-SG loss.\n\nPassive stretch eliminates the contribution of active contraction or SR calcium fluxes, but does not eliminate the effects of extracellular Ca2+fluxes through mechanically sensitive channels. Further, as previously shown, passive stretch causes greater Ca2+influx into myotubes lacking members of the SG complex [17], raising the possibility that the mechanical signal transduction pathways we evaluated previously may be modulated not only by the SG complex, but also by additional channels in the sarcolemma. To address this, we examined the contribution of calcium to the elevated p70S6K and ERK1/2 activity found in \u03b3-SG-/-muscles. We found that the elevation of P-ERK1/2 in the absence of \u03b3-SG was dependent on both internal and external sources of calcium. In contrast, the difference in basal P-p70S6K between C57 and \u03b3-SG-/-muscles was not calcium dependent. This suggests that while ERK1/2 activation may lie downstream of the calcium misregulation that occurs in SG-deficient muscle, changes in p70S6K activation may be a more direct consequence of the absence of the SG complex. This is of great interest given that \u03b3-SG has been shown to be important for mechanotransduction, but the downstream signaling pathways are uncharacterized [10,11]. Furthermore, p70S6K has been implicated in mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle, but the upstream initiation signals are not known [36,53-55]. However, it should be noted that SG-deficient muscle undergoes substantial degeneration and subsequent regeneration, which may also explain the elevated basal p70S6K, which is transiently increased during regeneration [56].\n\nOur study found that the pattern of differential p70S6K phosphorylation in response to stretch in \u03b3-SG-/-muscles was similar both for phosphorylation of T389, which correlates with kinase activity, and for T421/S424, two of the four phosphorylation sites in the autoinhibitory domain. Phosphorylation of T389 is mTOR-dependent, while phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain is carried out by proline-directed kinases. Furthermore, it is thought that phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain is necessary for phosphorylation of T389 [37]. The correlation between phosphorylation of T421/S424 and T389 in our isolated muscle model therefore suggests that phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain was the rate-limiting step for p70S6K activation, an intriguing prospect given that the autoinhibitory domain may be targeted by ERK1/2 [57]. Therefore, a future hypothesis to test is that differential p70S6K activation is a downstream consequence of differential ERK1/2 activation in \u03b3-SG-/-muscle. This would implicate Ca2+as an indirect modulator of p70S6K activity, since the increase in P-ERK1/2 in \u03b3-SG-/-muscle is dependent upon heightened Ca2+flux. It is worth noting that recent work by others has shown that stretch-induced activation of mTOR and p70S6K at T389 is independent of ERK1/2 [54], which can regulate mTOR via tuberous sclerosis proteins 1 and 2 and Raptor [58-60]. However, this pathway is separate from the putative direct phosphorylation of the p70S6K T421/S424 autoinhibitory domain sites by ERK1/2.\n\nOur experiments with rapamycin showed that, for both C57 and \u03b3-SG-/-muscles, phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 is mTOR-dependent, consistent with previous studies [36,37]. The T421/S424 autoinhibitory domain sites were phosphorylated in response to stretch in both C57 and \u03b3-SG-/-muscles, which was different to our initial experiment in stretched isolated muscles, where the C57 response had diminished by 90\u00a0min of stretching. However, in the presence of rapamycin, this response was not present. This is surprising given that the T421/S424 sites are not thought to be targeted by mTOR. Previous studies have shown these sites to be rapamycin-insensitive [36], but recent evidence suggests a modest mTOR dependence [61]. In \u03b3-SG-/-muscles, rapamycin had no effect on T421/S424 phosphorylation. Further experiments are needed to fully understand the role of mTOR on phosphorylation of the p70S6K autoinhibitory domain in C57 and \u03b3-SG-/-skeletal muscle. Interestingly, the stretch-induced phosphorylation of S6RP was rapamycin sensitive in C57 muscles, but not in \u03b3-SG-/-muscles. This suggests that an alternative pathway can bring about S6RP phosphorylation in \u03b3-SG-/-muscles when p70S6K is not activated. One possibility is that S6RP is phosphorylated by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, which is activated by ERK; this is consistent with the increase in basal ERK1/2 in \u03b3-SG-/-muscles, and the over-response of ERK2 on mechanical stimulation by eccentric contraction [10].\n\nWe did not observe a strong Akt response to passive stretch, or any difference between C57 and \u03b3SG-/-, implying that mTOR and/or p70S6K were being activated through Akt-independent pathways. This is consistent with previous studies showing that Akt does not respond to mechanical stimulation in skeletal muscle, and that p70S6K phosphorylation in response to stretch is independent of PI3K [62]. We also did not see increased phosphorylation of FAK in response to passive stretch in C2C12 cells or primary myotubes. Although integrins can participate in mechanotransduction, it appears that our cyclic passive stretch protocols did not cause integrin activation. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the details of crosstalk between SG-dependent and integrin-dependent signaling pathways, as well as the role of calcium in these signaling cascades.Based on our findings, we position \u03b3SG as a mechanosensor, schematized in Figure6, that is important for transient ERK1/2 activation during active contractions, as well as modulation of p70S6K activation during passive stretch. Because passive stretch does not appear to increase P-FAK or P-Akt, \u03b3SG is likely to regulate p70S6K through other pathways. These may include regulation of ERK1/2, which can promote p70S6K activation indirectly via mTOR or directly by phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain, and/or phosphatases such as PP2A that dephosphorylate p70S6K. Loss of \u03b3SG uncouples the response to stretch, which may contribute to muscle pathology.\n\nThe stability of the SG complex is directly affected in several LGMDs and in DMD, and a significant part of the pathology in these diseases appears to be inappropriate load sensing. The first step in therapeutic development is identifying and understanding the target, but little is currently known about the role of the SG complex in load sensing. Therefore, understanding the functions that are disrupted and the pathways that are involved in mechanotransduction involving the SG complex will help in the design of therapies for LGMDs and DMD. While restoration of a completely normal SG complex either through gene correction or protein replacement would also normalize mechanical signal transduction, this may not be possible for all mutations responsible for DMD and LGMD. It is known that localization of the SG complex is not the sole criterion for appropriate signaling [11]. Hence, other proteins may be necessary to correct signaling even when the complex is restored, and downstream pathways may emerge as more feasible therapeutic targets. We do not know whether the enhanced basal and stretch-responsive activation of p70S6K in \u03b3-SG-/-muscle contributes to pathology or compensates for it. Likewise, it is not clear whether inhibition of p70S6K would have a beneficial or a detrimental effect in dystrophic muscle. Muscle specific gene targeting of mTORC1 components induces myopathy [63,64] and overexpression of integrin \u03b17 can improve the dystrophic phenotype through increased survival signaling via p70S6K [65], suggesting that p70S6K inhibition would not be advantageous. However, treatment ofmdxmice with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin improves the dystrophic phenotype [66]. It is also interesting to note that p70S6K is inhibited by glucocorticoids, which are used in the treatment of DMD and LGMD [67].\n\nOur results begin to provide mechanistic insight into how mechanical signaling is disrupted and altered in the absence of \u03b3-SG. In addition to increasing our understanding of the normal function of the SG complex, there is potential to provide more refined targets that could be beneficial to patients either in isolation or in combination with other therapeutic approaches.",
    "conclusions": "We have identified p70S6K as part of a novel SG-dependent mechanosensitive signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that \u03b3-SG is required for the inactivation of p70S6K following its activation in response to mechanical stimulation. These studies provide new insights into the normal function of the SG complex, and the mechanisms by which its deficiency in some forms of muscular dystrophy may contribute to pathology."
