    "8. discussion": "Recent research demonstrates that microgravity significantly influences a wide array of biological processes, including immune responses, cell proliferation, and tissue regeneration. This unique environment disrupts key mechanisms such as mitochondrial biogenesis, liver metabolism, intestinal homeostasis, and stem cell differentiation, with profound implications for human health, particularly during prolonged space travel (Table 1).\n\nAdvances in understanding the effects of microgravity on stem cells, T cells, and immune function have created new opportunities for therapeutic innovations. Alterations in cellular biology under microgravity conditions have been shown to affect diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, kidney dysfunction, and infertility. Additionally, changes observed in endothelial cell behavior and multi-organ homeostasis highlight microgravity\u2019s potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine and deepen our understanding of human physiology in extreme environments.\n\nMicrogravity also holds significant promise for personalized medicine by facilitating progress in regenerative therapies, immune-based treatments, and approaches to managing chronic diseases. These findings emphasize microgravity\u2019s transformative potential to reshape cellular biology and its application to contemporary medical challenges, both in space and on Earth.\n\nAs a defining characteristic of space environments, microgravity imposes profound and multidimensional effects on biological and physiological systems, challenging conventional notions of human adaptation. The near-total absence of gravitational forces disrupts numerous bodily processes, posing risks to health during and after space missions. Key effects include fluid redistribution, increased intracranial pressure, muscle atrophy, and calcium-related bone density loss. At the molecular level, microgravity alters gene expression, cell signaling, and mitochondrial function, with significant consequences for energy production and cellular health [37,38,39].\n\nIn the immune system, microgravity reduces T cell activity and suppresses immune responses, increasing susceptibility to infections. These effects highlight the necessity of mitigating immune dysfunction during space travel. Similarly, studies have documented changes in the human microbiome, with potential implications for astronaut health and nutritional strategies during prolonged missions.\n\nMicrogravity research has also led to technological and medical breakthroughs with applications beyond space exploration. For instance, the study of proteins and drug crystals under microgravity has produced purer and more stable structures, offering new therapeutic possibilities for chronic diseases. Additionally, materials research in space has contributed to the development of innovative compounds with applications in both space and terrestrial industries. These advancements enhance the safety and efficiency of space missions while delivering broad scientific and technological benefits [39,40].\n\nDespite these advances, the complex effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity underline the need for further research, particularly in anticipation of missions to Mars and other distant destinations. Experimental models, such as space platforms and terrestrial simulators, remain indispensable tools for understanding the long-term impacts of microgravity and developing effective countermeasures [37,49].\n\nThe study of microgravity not only expands our understanding of how the human body adapts to extreme environments but also drives innovations with profound implications for science, medicine, and technology. By pushing the boundaries of what is known, this research establishes itself as a cornerstone for advancements that extend beyond space exploration, reshaping our perspectives on biology and human health [37,40].",
    "9. conclusions": "Microgravity presents a unique and multifaceted challenge for human biology, profoundly influencing cellular systems and physiological processes. This environment, distinct from terrestrial conditions, disrupts key biological functions such as immune activity, cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby destabilizing homeostasis critical for human health.\n\nEmerging research has highlighted the diverse effects of microgravity, including its impact on the immune system, where T cell function diminishes, increasing susceptibility to infections. Additionally, cancer cells exhibit altered behavior under microgravity, providing new insights into tumor progression and potential therapeutic approaches. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into how microgravity influences disease mechanisms and treatment responses.\n\nMicrogravity also affects the physiology of vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and bones, with implications for understanding tissue regeneration. Notably, stem cells exposed to microgravity demonstrate enhanced potential to produce mature, functional cells such as cardiomyocytes, offering transformative possibilities in regenerative medicine for repairing damaged cardiac tissue and other applications.\n\nThe continued exploration of microgravity\u2019s effects is essential not only for safeguarding astronaut health during prolonged space missions but also for advancing therapeutic strategies on Earth. The ability of microgravity to induce unique biological changes offers unparalleled opportunities to innovate in regenerative medicine, cancer treatment, and the management of immune dysfunctions.\n\nBy leveraging microgravity as a research platform, medicine and biotechnology stand to gain transformative insights and novel applications, extending the boundaries of our understanding of human biology and driving the development of therapies that can improve health outcomes both in space and on Earth."
